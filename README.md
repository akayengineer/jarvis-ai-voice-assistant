# jarvis-ai-voice-assistant
An intelligent voice-controlled AI assistant capable of system automation and real-time responses
# Jarvis AI – Intelligent Voice-Controlled Assistant 🤖🎙️

### Built by Amit Kumar | Applied AI System Builder  
**Tech Stack:** Python | SpeechRecognition | pyttsx3 | OS Automation | REST APIs | NLP

## 🧩 Overview
Jarvis AI is an intelligent voice-controlled desktop assistant inspired by the idea of human–AI collaboration.  
It continuously listens for commands, understands user intent, executes real-world actions, and responds conversationally.

Unlike basic chatbots, this assistant is capable of **system-level automation** and **API-driven intelligence** —  
making it closer to an *early-stage personal AI system*.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Voice Command Recognition** — Real-time command detection using `speech_recognition`
- **Wake Word Activation** — Always-listening mode with “Jarvis” or “Hello” triggers
- **System Control** — Open applications, take screenshots, start/stop recordings, shutdown system, and more
- **Online Intelligence** — Fetch weather, AQI, and knowledge-based responses via external APIs
- **Conversational Responses** — Contextual greetings, prompts, and human-like feedback
- **Automation Layer** — Seamless OS-level actions through Python’s automation modules
- **Emotion-aware design (in progress)** — Future goal: detect voice tone and respond empathetically

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- Libraries: `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `os`, `requests`, `datetime`, `time`
- APIs: Weather API, AQI API, Perplexity AI (key-based)
- Environment: Windows OS (tested)

## 🧪 Sample Commands
| Command | Function |
|----------|-----------|
| “Jarvis, open YouTube” | Launches browser and opens YouTube |
| “Start recording” | Activates screen recording |
| “What’s the weather today?” | Fetches live weather via API |
| “Take a screenshot” | Saves screenshot instantly |
| “Shutdown system” | Initiates shutdown procedure |

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Jarvis v2)
- 🎭 Emotion detection (voice & face sentiment)
- 🧠 Short-term memory (context retention)
- 🗣️ Personalized responses per user
- 🔗 Integration with smart devices / APIs
- 🌍 Web dashboard for monitoring & interaction

## 👨‍💻 Developer’s Note
> *“I started this project to explore how AI could understand human intent beyond words —  
> combining automation, perception, and emotional understanding.”*  
>  
> This project marked the beginning of my journey as an **Applied AI System Builder**,  
> focusing on **real-world intelligent agents** rather than theory-only models.
